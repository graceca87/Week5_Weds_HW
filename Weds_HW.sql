--SELECT title
--FROM film
--WHERE film_id IN ()

--7. Which actor has been in the least movies?

-- Find the actor id that appears in the least amount of films
SELECT count(actor_id), actor_id 
FROM film_actor
GROUP BY actor_id 
ORDER BY count(*);

-- Actor id 148 is in the least amount of films so we can narrow down our search with that info

-- You can specifically target this actor:
SELECT count(actor_id), actor_id 
FROM film_actor
GROUP BY actor_id 
HAVING actor_id = 148;

-- Now find the actors name in a list by number of films (joining actor with film_actor):
SELECT fa.actor_id, a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM film_actor fa 
JOIN actor a
ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
WHERE a.actor_id IN (
	SELECT count(actor_id) AS num_films
	FROM film_actor
	GROUP BY actor_id 
	ORDER BY num_films);

-- And you can find just this one actor's name with this query:
SELECT DISTINCT fa.actor_id, a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM film_actor fa 
JOIN actor a
ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
WHERE a.actor_id IN (
	SELECT count(actor_id)
	FROM film_actor

group BY c.country
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Answer: India

--SELECT actor_id, count(*)
--FROM film_actor
--GROUP BY actor_id 
--HAVING count(actor_id) BETWEEN 23 AND 26
--ORDER BY count(actor_id);


-- Get the names of those actors
SELECT DISTINCT a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM actor a 
JOIN film_actor fa 
ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
WHERE fa.actor_id IN (
	SELECT actor_id
	FROM film_actor
	GROUP BY actor_id
